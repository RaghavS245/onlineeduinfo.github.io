 <marquee style="background-color:transparent; color: yellow">WELCOME TO THIS PAGE. THIS SECTION OF THE WEBSITE TELLS YOU ALL ABOUT ONLINE EDUCATION AND IT'S ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES AND FINALLY, IS IT A BOON OR A BANE FOR THE STUDENTS? DON'T FORGET TO SCROLL DOWN TO READ MORE</marquee>
<h2 class="h222">  ONLINE EDUCATION IS ALL ABOUT -   <span class="changINGcontent"></span></h2>
<p class="p222" style="background-color: transparent;color: yellow">
   FIRSTLY, LET'S SEE WHAT ONLINE EDUCATION IS Online education COULD SIMPLY BE DEFINED AS ELECTRONICALLY SUPPORTED LEARNING THAT RELIES ON THE INTERNET FOR TEACHER-STUDENT INTERACTION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF STUDY MATERIALS.IT'S NOT EASY STUDYING ONLINE. DUE TO THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF THE YOUTH, ONLINE EDUCATION MUST MEET THE SAME QUALITY OF STUDYING AS OF OFFLINE CLASSROOMS.HOWEVER, WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF ONLINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, VIRTUAL SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE ENHANCED AUTOMATED PROCESSES, TO IDENTIFY PLAGIARISM AND FRAUD STUDENTS.EVERYTHING HAS IT'S OWN ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, AND ONLINE CLASSES ARE NOT AN EXCEPTION. THEY ALSO HAVE VARIOUS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES.<br></br>LET'S FIRST LOOK AT THE ADVANTAGE OF ONLINE CLASSES;<br></br>The main advantage of online education is its flexibility. A student can adjust his study timings as per his own needs. One can study indoor or outdoor, in a room or while travelling in a metro. It also saves time, energy or money of travelling to a specific destination to attain knowledge.Online education not only saves time and energy but also money. Education has mostly become a business in educational institutions these days be it coaching, schools or colleges, everyone is just trying to extract more and more money in the name of donations etc.<br></br> Online education saves students from falling prey to such fraudulent practices.<br></br> All one needs to do is have an internet connection in their system.In online education, one is free to choose his own combination of subjects regardless of the percentage required for taking up that particular subject. One can even take up odd combinations such as science with psychology or commerce with mass communication fearless of the fact that someone might judge them for their choices.<br></br>Since online education is available in most of the vernacular languages, there are no language barriers. One is free to learn new things in their own mother tongue as well. They are not bound to understand a particular language in order to follow the text, they can read the text or see a video related to it in whichever language they please, this gives them self-pride and confidence in themselves.<br></br>If a student does not has the time to take down notes while studying online, he can always save the page or convert it into a document and download it. Unlike in traditional classrooms where the matter gets erased from the board once the teacher is finished teaching, one can always refer to what he or she has studied previously online by simply clicking on the history of the site.<br></br> NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE DISADVANTAGES;<br></br>Itâ€™s often possible that we misinterpret what we actually see or read when we do not find somebody to actually explain it out to us. A single punctuation error changes the real meaning of the entire sentence and as it is said half and the improper information is even more harmful than no information. Hence, face to face interaction is very important for proper learning.<br></br>As the students are free from the regulations and boundaries of a proper classroom environment, it is quite obvious that the curriculum will not be maintained the way it should be. They might not study the materials in a routine manner and may start taking things lightly. There are high chances that the students might get distracted while learning online. Since there is no one to inspect them studying they might just not complete their work and leave it unfinished further harming their own selves in the long run.<br></br>Students are more likely to drop out as they are not giving their full commitment to their studies and take their studies too lightly. There will not be any particular mentor for the students to keep a track record on their progress and solve their doubts effectively. At places, where online education is difficult to reach, they might just drop out of the schools.<br></br> Online learning is helpful to only those students who have access to a proper internet connection and have devices such as laptop and computers. Students without it cannot rely on online learning. As we are aware of the World Pandemic of Coronavirus, the demand for online learning has surged up. Many institutions who have proper resources have gone online to take classes. But in a country like India, where internet connection is not available everywhere, not everyone is benefited with such resources so that they can go digital. There are many students who do not have a laptop, internet connection and money to even buy that. It totally depends on one's personal opinion as to what is more convenient for him/her- the old traditional teaching or the new online education whoever is having a choice between both. But our country is not yet ready to turn fully digital. Online teaching is definitely a boon and can be an add-on to traditional teaching but it cannot replace it.
