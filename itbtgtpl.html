  SWAYAM (study webs of active learning for young aspiring minds), an online learning platform run by Ministry of Human Resource Development, attracted at least 50,000 new subscribers since the announcement of lockdown period in India, effective March 23, 2020.These new subscribers joined a total of 25 lakh or more registered users with SWAYAM that has a repository of 1900 courses, which are being used by subscribers from over 60 countries, including India, USA, Canada, UK, UAE, Germany, Australia, Nepal, and Singapore.The ministry through its online education initiatives is trying to ensure that students can continue their learning during the lockdown period. “The response to this has been overwhelming,” said Union HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishak.Furthermore, he said the ministry runs learning platforms like Diksha, e-pathasala, NROER (National Repository of Open Educational Resources), NIOS (National Institute of Open Schooling) and other IT initiatives e-yantra (robotics education), FOSSEE (open source software for education), virtual labs and spoken learning programmes. Many of these platforms are run by the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT), an autonomous organization of the ministry of HRD.The minister said the number of users to these platforms has tripled in the last one week. The growth has been seen after provision of free access to the best learning resources at SWAYAM. Earlier, the courses of SWAYAM were time bound for which registration was needed in advance. “To use the lockdown period productively, students, parents and teachers can use these platforms free of cost, he said.The National Digital Library is now being accessed by about 43,000 people daily who are more than double the usual number of persons accessing it.
