   In the pre Covid-19 era, teachers could easily assess students by looking at their notebooks and reports. They could physically interact with them and get in the mind of  each student and teach them better. These methods proved really usefull as the teachers could easily find the weak points of their students and work with them in order to improve it. As a result school drop-out rate and failiure rate drastically reduced every year as even the poor children could go to the nearby govt schools and study, Improving the literacy rate in India.<br></br> Covid-19 completely changed the education industry as we know it.While school closures seem to present a logical solution to enforcing social distancing within communities, prolonged closures tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on the most vulnerable students. Not all parents are rich enough to give their child a phone or a laptop to study onliine. As a result, the education system saw it's highest dropout rate in history this year with most effect in rural areas. The assessment also doesen't show the child's true potential. with alll the study material being available online, it's very easy and common for among children to cheat and score full marks thereby it is unfair for those who study and give the test seriously. Due to the high  technological advancement it is very easy for one person to send all the work to another person within a few seconds, the child uses all the filters which makes it seem different from the original work and the teachers get fooled really easy and the child gets full marks without doing any work from the comfort of his own home.<br></br>
     A few schools from all over the world have conducted online exams but this situation in this case also favours the students who have more knowledge than the invigilators. Some strict teachers can ask the students to switch on their video and share their screen while giving the paper to check if he is cheating or not but it is really easy for some rich people who have 2 devices to exploit this situation and get more marks than others. Since most of the schools aren't able to organise exams that is why they take high percentage of  the marks of these assessments for final results, resulting in the lazy children who don't study to top the class, making it unfair for all those children who studied honestly for these assessments to get less marks. I would like to conclude by saying that these online assessments don't unleash the child's true potential. maybe in the future, but the online assessments which are being taken now could never replace the way the assessments were taken in the pre covid era.
